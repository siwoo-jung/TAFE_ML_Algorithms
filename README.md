# TAFE_ML_Algorithms
Final project of 'Machine Learning Algorithms' course provided by Institute of Applied Technology (IAT) in collaboration with TAFE NSW.
In this project, **supervised learning**, **unsupervised learning** and **semi-supervised learning** are used to evaluate the given scenario.

Your task is to help an organisation perform customer segmentation to better understand their customers’ needs and increase customer loyalty.
